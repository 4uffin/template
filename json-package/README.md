# **your-project-name**

A brief description of your project. This is a Node.js web application built with Express.js for handling API routes and Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database. The project is set up with developer-friendly scripts for running, testing, and building the application.

## **🚀 Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

To get this project up and running, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

* Node.js (\>=18.0.0)  
* npm (\>=9.0.0)

### **Installation**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.  
2. Navigate to the project directory.  
3. Install all required dependencies:  
   npm install

### **Environment Variables**

This project uses environment variables to manage sensitive data and configurations. Before running the application, create a .env file in the root of your project based on the .env.example file.

**Example .env file:**

\# MongoDB Connection String  
MONGODB\_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/your\_database\_name

\# Other environment variables can be added here  
\# e.g., PORT=3000

## **💻 Usage**

### **npm Scripts**

The following scripts are available to manage the project:

* **npm start**: Runs the application in development mode with nodemon. This script watches for any changes in your source files and automatically restarts the server, making development faster and more efficient.  
* **npm test**: Executes the test suite using Jest. It runs all tests with a .test.js or .spec.js extension to ensure the application's core functionality is working as expected.  
* **npm run build**: Builds the application for production using Webpack. This script bundles all the project's assets into a distributable format, optimizing them for performance.

## **📂 Project Structure**

└── tests/

* src/: Contains all the application's source code.  
* src/controllers/: Houses the business logic and functions that handle incoming requests.  
* src/models/: Defines the data structure and schema for your MongoDB collections using Mongoose.  
* src/routes/: Contains the route definitions for your API endpoints.  
* app.js and server.js: The entry points for the application.

## **🌐 API Endpoints**

The API is built using Express.js and provides the following endpoints. All endpoints return data in JSON format.

### **Example Endpoint: GET /api/items**

* **Description:** Retrieves a list of all items.  
* **Method:** GET  
* **URL:** http://localhost:3000/api/items  
* **Success Response:**  
  * **Code:** 200 OK  
  * **Content:**  
    \[  
      {  
        "\_id": "60c72b2f9b1d8e001c8a1e2f",  
        "name": "Item 1",  
        "description": "Description of item 1"  
      },  
      {  
        "\_id": "60c72b2f9b1d8e001c8a1e30",  
        "name": "Item 2",  
        "description": "Description of item 2"  
      }  
    \]

### **Example Endpoint: POST /api/items**

* **Description:** Creates a new item.  
* **Method:** POST  
* **URL:** http://localhost:3000/api/items  
* **Body (JSON):**  
  {  
    "name": "New Item",  
    "description": "A brand new item"  
  }

* **Success Response:**  
  * **Code:** 201 Created  
  * **Content:**  
    {  
      "\_id": "60c72b2f9b1d8e001c8a1e31",  
      "name": "New Item",  
      "description": "A brand new item"  
    }

## **🚀 Deployment**

To deploy this application to a production environment, you should use a process manager like PM2 to keep the server running and manage restarts.

1. First, install PM2 globally:  
   npm install pm2 \-g

2. Then, start your application with PM2 from the project root:  
   pm2 start index.js \--name "your-project-name-app"

3. To save the process list and ensure it restarts on server boot:  
   pm2 save

## **🐳 Docker**

Docker is a great way to containerize your application and ensure a consistent environment across different machines.

### **Dockerfile**

Create a Dockerfile in the root of your project:

\# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image  
FROM node:18-alpine

\# Set the working directory  
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

\# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the container  
COPY package\*.json ./

\# Install app dependencies  
RUN npm install

\# Copy the rest of the application source code  
COPY . .

\# Expose the port the app runs on  
EXPOSE 3000

\# Run the application  
CMD \[ "npm", "start" \]

### **Docker Commands**

1. Build the Docker image:  
   docker build \-t your-project-name .

2. Run the Docker container:  
   docker run \-p 3000:3000 your-project-name

## **⁉️ Troubleshooting**

* **"Missing environment variables\!"**: Ensure you have created a .env file in the project's root directory and that all required variables (like MONGODB\_URI) are present and correctly formatted.  
* **npm install fails**: This is often due to network issues or an outdated Node.js/npm version. Try running npm cache clean \--force and then npm install again.
