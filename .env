# A typical .env file is used to store environment variables for an application.
# It's a key part of the "config as code" approach, allowing you to separate sensitive information (like API keys and database credentials) and environment-specific settings (like development vs. production) from your source code.
# This makes your project more secure and easier to manage across different environments without changing the code itself.
# It should always be included in your .gitignore file to prevent it from being committed to version control.

# Application-specific environment variables
APP_NAME="My Cool App"
APP_VERSION="1.0.0"

# API keys and secrets (replace with your actual values)
API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
API_SECRET="your_api_secret_here"
AUTH_SECRET="your_authentication_secret_here"

# Database connection string
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://user:password@host:port/database"
