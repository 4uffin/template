# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to a positive, healthy, and welcoming community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances of any kind.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission ("doxxing").
* Disruptive behavior or sustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. This includes actions taken outside of these spaces that have a negative impact on community health.

---

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and all maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

### Enforcement Actions

Community leaders will follow a tiered system of corrective action in response to behavior they deem inappropriate, harmful, or offensive.

1.  **Correction:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
2.  **Warning:** A warning with specified consequences for continued behavior. This may include a temporary ban from interacting with the community for a specified period of time.
3.  **Permanent Ban:** A permanent ban from any public interaction within the community for demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards.
