## **üìÇ Project Structure**

A well-structured project is easier for new developers to understand and contribute to. This is a typical layout for a modern repository.

### **Essential Files**

* README.md: The main file that introduces your project. It's the first thing users and contributors see.  
* LICENSE: Specifies the license under which your project is distributed, such as MIT or Apache 2.0. This is crucial for legal clarity.  
* .gitignore: A file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore and not commit to the repository (e.g., node\_modules, .env, build artifacts).  
* package.json / requirements.txt: These files list the project's dependencies, making it easy for others to set up the development environment.  
* CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md: Sets a clear standard for community behavior and ensures a welcoming environment for all contributors.  
* CONTRIBUTING.md: A detailed guide on how to contribute to the project, including information on setting up the local environment, running tests, and submitting pull requests.

### **Common Directories**

* /src: The source code for your application. This is where the main logic lives.  
* /dist or /build: Contains the compiled or bundled output of your source code, ready for deployment.  
* /docs: All project documentation, including tutorials, API references, and architecture overviews.  
* /tests or /spec: Holds all unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for the project.  
* /assets: Static assets like images, fonts, and other media files used by the project.  
* /.github: A special directory used by GitHub for configuration files. It's where you define your **CI/CD workflows** (workflows/) and issue templates (ISSUE\_TEMPLATE/).

## **Design and Architecture**

A high-level overview of the project's design, including a diagram or a summary of the key components and how they interact.

## **Data Models & Schema**

This project's data is structured as follows. You can view the full schema in the schema.json file.

**Example User Schema (JSON Schema):**

{  
  "$id": "https://example.com/schemas/user.json",  
  "title": "User",  
  "type": "object",  
  "properties": {  
    "id": { "type": "string" },  
    "username": { "type": "string" },  
    "email": { "type": "string", "format": "email" }  
  },  
  "required": \["id", "username", "email"\]  
}

## **Configuration**

This project uses a config.json file to manage more complex settings.

**Example config.json:**

{  
  "database": {  
    "host": "localhost",  
    "port": 5432  
  },  
  "logging": {  
    "level": "info"  
  }  
}

## **Localization (i18n)**

2. Translate the strings from locales/en.json into your language.  
3. Open a pull request with your changes.

## **User Data & Telemetry Policy**

This project **does not** collect any personal data or usage telemetry by default. If we ever decide to implement optional analytics to improve the project, we will provide a clear opt-in process and a detailed breakdown of what data is collected and why.

## **Deprecation Policy**

For long-term maintenance and stability, we follow a deprecation policy. A feature is considered deprecated after it has been marked as such in a release. It will then be removed in the next major version to allow users time to migrate.

## **Accessibility**

We are committed to making this project accessible to everyone. We follow [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) guidelines and strive to ensure a seamless experience for all users. If you encounter any accessibility issues, please report them to us by opening an issue.

## **Code Signing & Verification**

To ensure the integrity of our releases, all binaries are signed with a GPG key. You can find our public key in the KEYS file in the root of the repository.

To verify a release, download the binary and the .asc signature file, then run:

gpg \--verify \<release-file\>.asc \<release-file\>
